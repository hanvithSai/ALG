# Project ALG Audio Version

**Project ALG Audio Version** is an AI-powered system designed to generate song lyrics based on user inputs and provide an audio output of the generated lyrics. The project integrates natural language processing (NLP) models to create original song lyrics in multiple languages and styles, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to convert the lyrics into a spoken form. The system supports both text-based and voice-based inputs, making it versatile and easy to use for a wide range of users.

## Product Design and Features

### 1. User Inputs:
- **Text Input**: Users can type a description of the song's theme or scene (e.g., a love story, war scene, emotional farewell) in a text box.
- **Voice Input**: Users can also speak the description using their microphone, which will be transcribed into text using live transcription.

### 2. Live Transcription:
- The voice input is processed in real-time, and users can see the transcription of their speech, allowing them to verify and edit the description if necessary.

### 3. Lyrics Generation:
- The system generates song lyrics based on the description, genre, and emotion provided by the user.
- **Genre Options**: Users can select from multiple genres such as Classical, Pop, Rock, Hip-hop, Jazz, and Country.
- **Emotion Input**: Users can specify the emotion they want the song to evoke (e.g., sadness, joy, excitement).

### 4. Multi-Language Support:
- The generated lyrics can be created in multiple languages, including English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.
- **English Script Option**: For non-English languages, the user can opt to see the lyrics written using the English alphabet (transliteration) for better understanding.

### 5. Audio Output:
- After generating the lyrics, the system provides a spoken version of the lyrics using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology.
- Users can listen to the generated lyrics in a natural-sounding voice, with audio downloadable for future use.

### 6. Gradio Interface:
- The user interface is built using **Gradio**, which provides a simple, interactive platform for users to input their song descriptions, view live transcriptions, and receive both the lyrics and audio output.
- The interface is intuitive, with radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus for easy selection of input methods, languages, and genres.
