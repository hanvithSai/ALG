Project ALG Audio Version is an AI-powered system designed to generate song lyrics based on user inputs and provide an audio output of the generated lyrics. The project integrates NLP models to create original song lyrics in multiple languages and styles, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to convert the lyrics into a spoken form.
